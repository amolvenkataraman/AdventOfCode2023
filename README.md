# Advent of Code Solutions

Solutions are provided in Python and/or C++. The logic used is usually nearly identical for all provided languages unless a different method had to be used due to language limitations.

Please be a good person. While it is acceptable to use this code to understand the solution and debug your own, please do not use this code to try to get a leaderboard position. This makes it unfair for the people who are writing the code on their own. You may use this code to calculate your solutions after the leaderboard expires (24 hours since problem release).
